# Framework of GAN Inversion

## Introcuction
* You can implement your own inversion idea using our repo. We offer a full range of tuning settings (in hparams.py), some excellent backbones and classics loss functions. You can modify the arch of network or loss easily.

## Recent Updates
* 2021.9.1 The simplfied framework of GAN Inversion is released.

## Requirements
* pip install git+git://github.com/lehduong/torch-warmup-lr.git
* PyTorch1.7

 

## TODO
- [ ] DDP
- [ ] More Backbones
